# nLayeredDemo - Java Multi-Layered Architecture Project

This project is a sample implementation of a multi-layered (n-layered) architecture using Java. It was developed with clean code principles, separation of concerns, and SOLID design principles in mind.

## 🧱 Layers

The project is structured into the following main layers:

- **entities** → Contains the entity classes (models)
- **dataAccess** → Handles data access operations (DAO pattern)
- **business** → Business logic is implemented here (Service, Manager)
- **core** → Contains shared services and infrastructure components (e.g., Logger)

## 🎯 Technologies Used

- Java 17+
- Eclipse IDE
- OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
- Layered Architecture
- Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism
- Dependency Injection
- Logger Service (in core module)

## 🎓 Purpose

The aim of this project is to provide a real-world learning experience for developers who want to better understand how to build scalable and maintainable applications using enterprise-level architecture in Java.
